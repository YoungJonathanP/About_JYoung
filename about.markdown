Greetings! My name is Jonathan and for as long as I have known computers exist I have always been facinated by what makes them work. I view computer science as an ever evolving puzzle with countless solutions to any one given question. I strive to make simple, but effective code. 

My goal is to assist in the creation of systems that aid autonomous vehicle travel that promote flawless safety as the paramount foundation of the driving principals.
